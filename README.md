note: before you can run this, you will need to create a mongodb database.<br/>
You will also need to have node and npm installed.<br/><br/>
to start make a new folder and open a terminal.<br/>
$ git clone https://github.com/orionwolfhubbard/pong.git<br/>
edit server/mongodb/Database.js to include your own mongodb database credentials.<br/>
to start the server:<br/>
$ cd server<br/>
$ npm i<br/>
$ node server<br/>
then to start the client up:<br/>
open a new terminal<br/>
$ cd client<br/>
$ npm i<br/>
$ npm start<br/>
If all goes well, a browser should open up the log in screen and you can start using my program :D
